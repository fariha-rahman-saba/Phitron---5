Problem Statement

You are given an array H representing the heights of N vertical lines positioned at equally spaced intervals along a two-dimensional plane. The i-th line's height is represented by the integer H where 0<=i<N and the height will be unique. 

You need to find the two lines, such that together with the x-axis forms a container that can hold the most water in term of height.

Note: Print the left index first, then the right index.

Input Format

First line will contain T , the number of test cases. 
First line of each test case will contain N. 
Second line of each test case will contain the array H. 
Constraints 1. 1<=T<=10^3, 2. 2<=N<=10^5 3. Hi<=10^9 

Output Format

Ouptut two integers, the index of those two lines that can contain the most water in term of height.
